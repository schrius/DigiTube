General Problem
Many small mobile phone retailers do not have an application that be able to handle their daily transactions, 
inventory, to-do list, customer information, and income and expense report, since such application does not 
even exist and they are not able to offer one. Their to-do list is the most important function to the business. 
Everyday employees have to follow the to-do list to call Mobile carrier agents, pay customer bill, port in and 
port out, refill, activate new sim for customers, and customer may require to port in or activate new sim at a 
specific time, such before 10 AM, after 7 PM and etc. Pricing is also too troublesome. Price for a cell phone 
may change every week, and employees have to remember them along with the price of all accessories and services
the store provided which price may also change. It is so common that employees was not informed the price was 
already changed, and forget a port in is not completed due the some system error, or process is too complicated 
to done on time.

Proposed Solution
This application should be able to handle all the daily transaction and generate a summary report for the day, 
month and year; provide detail of the inventory of the store; print a receipt/invoice when a transaction is complete; 
search and display customer information and transaction history; allow owner/manager to update the price, add/modify 
product list, edit the to-do list. Employee will be able to get the price by searching the name or UPC of the product, 
and view, add and complete the tasks on the to-do list. Activation order is automatically add to To-do list. The list 
should be able to display a corresponding status for the task, waiting, in progress, or complete. Employee will also 
be able offer a lower price to customer as long as the price is not below the minimum price which set by the business 
owner. An unpaid report/list that indicates transactions that done by phone but customer has not yet paid off. Sim card 
expiration date will be automatically computed after each refill or activation and insert into database.
